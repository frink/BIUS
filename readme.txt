This is a demo of the BIUS editor built with pure Javascript without images.
It is desined to intialize fast and be endlessly configurable. It is not yet
ready for prime-time and requires more browser testing. It should work in
every major browser but it has only extensively been tested with WebKit,
Gecko and Opera based browsers. IE still needs testing before calling this
complete. Also, there are still unresolved issues with HTML cleaning that
need to be addressed. COnsider this a proof-of-concept release...
